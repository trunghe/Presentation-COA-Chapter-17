# 17.2 SYMMETRIC MULTIPROCESSORS - ĐA XỬ LÝ SONG SONG

"Until fairly recently, virtually all single-user personal computers and most workstations contained a single general-purpose microprocessor. As demands for performance increase and as the cost of microprocessors continues to drop, vendors have introduced systems with an SMP organization. The term SMP refers to a computer hardware architecture and also to the operating system behavior that reflects that architecture. An SMP can be defined as a standalone computer system with the following characteristics:"

Cho đến gần đây, gần như tất cả các máy tính cá nhân 1 người dùng và hầu hết các máy trạm làm việc (?) (workstations) có duy nhất một vi xử lý đa năng. Với nhu cầu tốc độ xử lý ngày càng tăng và giá thành của vi xử lý ngày càng giảm, các nhà cung cấp giới thiệu các hệ thống với tổ chức SMP. Thuật ngữ SMP vừa dùng để nói về một kiến trúc phần cứng máy tính, vừa về cách xử lý của hệ điều hành phản ánh kiến trúc này (??) (the operating system behaviour that reflects that architecture). Một SMP có thể được định nghĩa như một hệ thống máy tính độc lập (?) (standalone) với các đặc điểm sau:

"1. There are two or more similar processors of comparable capability."

1. Có 2 hay nhiều lõi giống nhau về khả năng xử lý (?) (similar processors of comparable capability).

"2. These processors share the same main memory and I/O facilities and are interconnected by a bus or other internal connection scheme, such that memory access time is approximately the same for each processor."

2. Các lõi dùng chung một bộ nhớ và các phương tiện I/O và được liên kết bởi một bus hoặc một hệ thống kết nối trong khác (other internal connection scheme), sao cho thời gian truy cập bộ nhớ là gần như giống hệt nhau cho từng lõi.

3. All processors share access to I/O devices, either through the same channels or through different channels that provide paths to the same device.

4. All processors can perform the same functions (hence the term symmetric).

5. The system is controlled by an integrated operating system that provides interaction between processors and their programs at the job, task, file, and data element levels.

Points 1 to 4 should be self-explanatory. Point 5 illustrates one of the contrasts with a loosely coupled multiprocessing system, such as a cluster. In the latter, the physical unit of interaction is usually a message or complete file. In an SMP, individual data elements can constitute the level of interaction, and there can be a high degree of cooperation between processes.

The operating system of an SMP schedules processes or threads across all of the processors. An SMP organization has a number of potential advantages over a uniprocessor organization, including the following:

• Performance: If the work to be done by a computer can be organized so that some portions of the work can be done in parallel, then a system with multiple processors will yield greater performance than one with a single processor of the same type (Figure 17.3).

• Availability: In a symmetric multiprocessor, because all processors can perform the same functions, the failure of a single processor does not halt the machine. Instead, the system can continue to function at reduced performance.

• Incremental growth: A user can enhance the performance of a system by adding an additional processor.

• Scaling: Vendors can offer a range of products with different price and performance characteristics based on the number of processors configured in the system.

It is important to note that these are potential, rather than guaranteed, benefits. The operating system must provide tools and functions to exploit the parallelism in an SMP system.

An attractive feature of an SMP is that the existence of multiple processors is transparent to the user. The operating system takes care of scheduling of threads or processes on individual processors and of synchronization among processors.

		Organization

Figure 17.4 depicts in general terms the organization of a multiprocessor system. There are two or more processors. Each processor is self-contained, including a control unit, ALU, registers, and, typically, one or more levels of cache. Each processor has access to a shared main memory and the I/O devices through some form of interconnection mechanism. The processors can communicate with each other through memory (messages and status information left in common data areas). It may also be possible for processors to exchange signals directly. The memory is often organized so that multiple simultaneous accesses to separate blocks of memory are possible. In some configurations, each processor may also have its own private main memory and I/O channels in addition to the shared resources.

The most common organization for personal computers, workstations, and servers is the time-shared bus. The time-shared bus is the simplest mechanism for constructing a multiprocessor system (Figure 17.5). The structure and interfaces are basically the same as for a single-processor system that uses a bus interconnection. The bus consists of control, address, and data lines. To facilitate DMA transfers from I/O subsystems to processors, the following features are provided:

• Addressing: It must be possible to distinguish modules on the bus to determine the source and destination of data.

• Arbitration: Any I/O module can temporarily function as “master.” A mechanism is provided to arbitrate competing requests for bus control, using some sort of priority scheme.

• Time-sharing: When one module is controlling the bus, other modules are locked out and must, if necessary, suspend operation until bus access is achieved.

These uniprocessor features are directly usable in an SMP organization. In this latter case, there are now multiple processors as well as multiple I/O processors all attempting to gain access to one or more memory modules via the bus.

The bus organization has several attractive features:

• Simplicity: This is the simplest approach to multiprocessor organization. The physical interface and the addressing, arbitration, and time-sharing logic of each processor remain the same as in a single-processor system.

• Flexibility: It is generally easy to expand the system by attaching more processors to the bus.

• Reliability: The bus is essentially a passive medium, and the failure of any attached device should not cause failure of the whole system.

The main drawback to the bus organization is performance. All memory references pass through the common bus. Thus, the bus cycle time limits the speed of the system. To improve performance, it is desirable to equip each processor with a cache memory. This should reduce the number of bus accesses dramatically. Typically, workstation and PC SMPs have two levels of cache, with the L1 cache internal (same chip as the processor) and the L2 cache either internal or external. Some processors now employ a L3 cache as well.

The use of caches introduces some new design considerations. Because each local cache contains an image of a portion of memory, if a word is altered in one cache, it could conceivably invalidate a word in another cache. To prevent this, the other processors must be alerted that an update has taken place. This problem is known as the cache coherence problem and is typically addressed in hardware rather than by the operating system. We address this issue in Section 17.4.

		Multiprocessor Operating System Design Considerations

An SMP operating system manages processor and other computer resources so that the user perceives a single operating system controlling system resources. In fact, such a configuration should appear as a single-processor multiprogramming system. In both the SMP and uniprocessor cases, multiple jobs or processes may be active at one time, and it is the responsibility of the operating system to schedule their execution and to allocate resources. A user may construct applications that use multiple processes or multiple threads within processes without regard to whether a single processor or multiple processors will be available. Thus, a multiprocessor operating system must provide all the functionality of a multiprogramming system plus additional features to accommodate multiple processors. Among the key design issues:

• Simultaneous concurrent processes: OS routines need to be reentrant to allow several processors to execute the same IS code simultaneously. With multiple processors executing the same or different parts of the OS, OS tables and management structures must be managed properly to avoid deadlock or invalid operations.

• Scheduling: Any processor may perform scheduling, so conflicts must be avoided. The scheduler must assign ready processes to available processors.

• Synchronization: With multiple active processes having potential access to shared address spaces or shared I/O resources, care must be taken to provide effective synchronization. Synchronization is a facility that enforces mutual exclusion and event ordering.

• Memory management: Memory management on a multiprocessor must deal with all of the issues found on uniprocessor machines, as is discussed in Chapter 8. In addition, the operating system needs to exploit the available hardware parallelism, such as multiported memories, to achieve the best performance. The paging mechanisms on different processors must be coordinated to enforce consistency when several processors share a page or segment and to decide on page replacement.

• Reliability and fault tolerance: The operating system should provide graceful degradation in the face of processor failure. The scheduler and other portions of the operating system must recognize the loss of a processor and restructure management tables accordingly.
